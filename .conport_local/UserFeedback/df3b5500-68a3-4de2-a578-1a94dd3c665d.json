    "query": "What are all of the defined Elm Harmonies in the complete lincguistic reference?",
    "response": "<p>In the sacred groves where the ancient Elm trees whisper their secrets, there exist thirteen harmonious currents that flow through those attuned to the green and gold traditions. These Elm Harmonic Currents are recorded meticulously within the Elm Archive, a sprawling tome bound in supple bark and adorned with intricate pictographs of leafy tendrils. Here lies the complete linguistic reference for Elm Harmony:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Verdant Flow</strong>: <em>Emlun ehmber lum</em> - The foundation current, it opens the harmonist to emotional attunement, allowing them to sense the subtle shifts in atmosphere around them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gossamer Veil</strong>: <em>Emlun efah elun</em> - This harmony creates a translucent barrier that dampens harsh emotions and quiets discordant energies, fostering understanding and unity among those who gather within its embrace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tranquil Boughs</strong>: <em>Emlun terem tahlun</em> - Calming waves of green radiate outwards from the harmonist, soothing turbulent emotions and encouraging serenity in those near enough to be touched by these gentle currents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Whispering Leaves</strong>: <em>Emlun wispar lem</em> - This harmony brings forth soft, melodic whispers from Elm leaves, each rustle carrying subtle messages or secrets known only to the listener's heart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Nurturing Sap</strong>: <em>Emlun sapir nunlun</em> - A warm, life-giving current that flows into another being, supporting their spiritual growth and healing emotional wounds, much like the sap of an Elm tree fuels its own life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rooted Strength</strong>: <em>Emlun rotan tahran</em> - By connecting deeply with the roots of nearby Elm trees, the harmonist draws forth reserves of resilience and determination, enabling them to weather emotional storms with steadfast composure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hollow Trunk</strong>: <em>Emlun holwan turan</em> - This harmony allows the harmonist's spirit to merge temporarily with the vast interior space of an Elm tree, granting them access to ancient memories and wisdom stored within its wooden heart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flowering Branches</strong>: <em>Emlun fluran branchan</em> - Blooms burst into life along the branches of nearby Elm trees, attracting beneficial creatures and fostering growth in flora and fauna alike, reflecting the harmonist's own capacity for love and compassion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wind-borne Seeds</strong>: <em>Emlun winbor senud</em> - The harmonist channels their emotional energy into lightweight seeds that ride the winds far and wide, spreading understanding, unity, and renewal wherever they alight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moonlit Canopy</strong>: <em>Emlun munlun kanupie</em> - Beneath this harmony's silver glow, shadows are banished, secrets revealed, and hidden emotions laid bare for all to see, fostering truthfulness and openness among those gathered together under its influence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Storm-tossed Limbs</strong>: <em>Emlun storme tanlimb</em> - With fierce winds and thunderous roars, this harmony unleashes the harmonist's pent-up emotional turmoil, purging them of negative feelings and leaving behind a sense of cathartic release and renewal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Starlit Embrace</strong>: <em>Emlun starnlun embran</em> - A tender, enveloping current that draws lovers close, deepening their bond and fostering understanding between them, while offering solace to those who grieve or feel lost along life's winding path.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ancestral Echoes</strong>: <em>Emlun ansester ehohay</em> - This harmony summons forth the spirits of Elm harmonists past, allowing them to share their knowledge and guidance with living practitioners, forging connections across time and fostering the continuous growth of Elm Harmony.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These thirteen currents form the core of Elm Harmony, each one a testament to the profound emotional depth and versatility of those who wield this sacred gift.</p>",
