    "query": "I would like him to be more prevalent than appearing in two chapters. Can you add more ways to incorporate him?",
    "response": "<p>Absolutely, here are several ways to incorporate Rowan more prominently throughout the narrative without disrupting the flow or themes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mentorship Sessions with Iris</strong>:</li>\n<li><em>Chapter 6</em>: After the discovery of Yew Harmony, Iris seeks guidance from Rowan about its potential applications and dangers. They engage in regular mentorship sessions where she shares her insights into threshold harmonics while he provides historical context and cautionary tales.\n     <code>In the quiet sanctuary of his private study, Rowan listened intently as Iris spoke of her latest revelations. His fingers tapped a slow rhythm on the armrest, a thoughtful counterpoint to her words. \"Careful, Iris,\" he warned, \"Yew Harmony may be our key to understanding Veilia, but it's also a Pandora's box.\"</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Chapter 15</em>: Rowan introduces Iris to ancient Elm texts that discuss harmonic balance, helping her refine her understanding of threshold harmonics and their role in maintaining stability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Political Machinations</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Chapter 18</em>: As Linnea's influence grows within the Arbory of Elm, Rowan begins quietly gathering evidence of her manipulation, enlisting the help of trusted practitioners like Iris, Laurel, and Briar to document suspicious activities.\n     <code>\"Rowan,\" Iris asked one evening as they pored over ancient texts in his study, \"have you considered that Linnea might be acting under some kind of influence?\" Her voice was barely above a whisper, but the weight of her words hung heavy between them.</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Chapter 24</em>: Rowan works behind the scenes to rally support among other Elders and influential practitioners for investigating Linnea's activities more thoroughly. He delegates tasks to Iris and others, creating a network of allies dedicated to uncovering the truth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wild Harmony Exchange</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Chapter 10</em>: Rowan invites Alder Nightwind to lead weekly workshops at the Arbory of Ash, introducing practitioners to wild harmonies in a controlled environment. Iris is one of his most eager participants, and their shared exploration deepens their bond.\n     <code>Alder's lessons were like nothing they'd ever experienced\u2014chaotic, unpredictable, exhilarating. Rowan watched with approval as Iris navigated the dissonant melodies, her innate talent for threshold harmonics making her a natural in this new terrain.</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Chapter 21</em>: Rowan collaborates with Alder on an experimental harmonic designed to detect residual influence from Veilia's corruption. They enlist Iris and Reed's help to refine and test the technique.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Reed Dancer's Lament</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Chapter 13</em>: Rowan shares his memories of the Reed Dancer's manifestation in Underfen with Iris, encouraging her to explore its relevance to Yew Harmony and Veilia's corruption.\n     <code>\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Rowan murmured, lost in thought. \"The way it moved through harmonics as if they were physical spaces... It reminded me of something ancient, something forgotten.\"</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Chapter 27</em>: When Iris begins experiencing visions of the Reed Dancer again, she confides in Rowan about their intensity and frequency. He offers guidance on managing harmonic visions while also researching potential connections to Veilia.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Council's Secret Investigations</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li><em>Chapter 19</em>: Rowan, along with Sorcha Silverfrost and Thorne Ironroot, secretly begins investigating Linnea's claims of Yew Harmony's danger by studying historical records and consulting with reclusive harmonic scholars.\n     <code>In hushed tones, they discussed their findings over shared meals in the Oak Arbor's private dining hall. Iris was often present, her insights proving invaluable as they pieced together the puzzle of Yeb Harmony's suppression.</code></li>\n<li><em>Chapter 31</em>: The trio enlists Iris and Reed to help them analyze harmonic residue left behind by Linnea's corrupted experiments, aiming to understand the extent of Veilia's influence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By incorporating Rowan more frequently through these story threads, you'll create a richer narrative while maintaining focus on Iris's journey and growth. Each interaction should provide insight into his character and motivations while also advancing the plot or deepening themes related to harmony, corruption, and political intrigue.</p>",
