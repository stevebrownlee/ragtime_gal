    "query": "I want you to design the harmony again. I'll provide the definition again for clarity:\n\nUsing the syllables and definitions of Elm Harmony, generate a new harmony that Elm lyrists can perform that instill a particular emotional resonance field on an object or area",
    "response": "<p>In the verdant heart of the Elm Arbory, where whispers of connection breathed life into every leaf and branch, Lyrist Elara crafted a new harmony. She had been pondering the essence of her tradition - flexibility, intuition, emotional currents - seeking to weave them into a tapestry that would evoke a specific resonance within the world around her.</p>\n<p>After many moonlit nights spent among the Elm trees, listening to their ancient music and communing with their spirits, Elara found what she sought. She named this new harmony \"Eldritch Embrace,\" for it was meant to wrap an area or object in a soft, welcoming glow of warmth and comfort.</p>\n<p>To manifest Eldritch Embrace, the Elm lyrist begins by drawing the Tree Music sigil of Elm upon the ground with their finger, inhaling deeply as they trace its intricate lines. They then exhale gently, vocalizing the syllables \"Ehm... Ehh... Ehm...\" in a slow, steady rhythm that mirrors the pulse of the Elm heartwood.</p>\n<p>As the lyrist repeats these syllables, they adopt a posture reminiscent of the Elm's flexible trunk, bending slightly at the waist and extending their arms like branches reaching out to embrace. Their hands move gracefully through the air, weaving an invisible web of harmony around them.</p>\n<p>The emotional resonance field generated by Eldritch Embrace manifests as a soft, golden light that begins at the lyrist's fingertips and spreads outward in gentle waves. It bathes everything it touches in a warm, inviting glow, imbuing the area or object with feelings of safety, belonging, and tranquility.</p>\n<p>Those caught within Eldritch Embrace often report feeling a sense of calm wash over them, as if they've found solace in an old friend's embrace. Tensions ease, breaths deepen, and hearts open, allowing for deeper connection and understanding among those present.</p>\n<p>Elara first demonstrated this harmony at the annual Elm Arbory gathering, where she cast Eldritch Embrace over the assembled crowd. As the golden light washed over them, laughter filled the air, and strangers became friends in an instant. From that day forward, Eldritch Embrace became a staple of Elm lyrists' repertoires, beloved for its power to foster unity and harmony among those who shared its embrace.</p>\n<p>Yet as with all harmonies, caution must be exercised when using Eldritch Embrace. Prolonged exposure can lead to complacency or dependence on the harmony's comforting effects, potentially dulling one's ability to navigate emotional currents independently. Thus, Elm lyrists are taught to use this harmony judiciously, reserving its embrace for moments when genuine connection and understanding are most needed.</p>\n<p>In this way, Eldritch Embrace serves as a testament to the power of Elm Harmony, reminding all who experience it that true harmony lies not merely in the notes we sing but also in the bonds we forge through shared emotion and understanding.</p>",
